This team notebook was used during the NAC 2022 competition. The format is based on the [Stanford Cardinal '16 Notebook](https://github.com/jaehyunp/stanfordacm/tree/master/stanford-cardinal-16). A compiled pdf is found in UMN_ICPC_TRD_2022.pdf. The thingstoinclude.txt file contains all topics we were considering to add while planning.

**While printing, make sure that the KACTL geo code does not get cut off on the left or right sides!** If needed, reduce the KACTL pdf's text width down from 1.05 at the end of the document.
